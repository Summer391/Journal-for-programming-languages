December 6th/7th 2025, 12:36 AM (7th): Today I started learning C++. I'm on windows so it took a bit of effort to get it set up in vscode and whatnot but it's pretty fun seeing the code produce something actually real and visible.
I think one of my end goals for programming and computer science in general is to make like a physics simulation thing, where I can visualize whatever scenario I want using inputs or whatever. I know that's probably like 3 years away, but 3 years are gonna pass by anyway,
so I may as well do that at the same time. In today's session I studied a little bit of syntax, a few variable types, printing, comments, and line breaks/spaces. I don't really think this is gonna be easy, but, then again, I study math and
I find it hard maybe 15% of the time, 20% of the time at the worst, so, I guess this shouldn't be absolutely petrifying in comparison. At least, I can only hope it won't be.
