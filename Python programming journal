Oh my god it is not automatically creating new lines, that's gonna be a bit of an adjustment. Anyway:
I've studied a bit of programming before, so I'm not a totally new to it, but I'd say i'm still a big noob. 
My STEM journey has been exclusively math and physics and other related stuff. I guess computers and programming is a nice addition/deviation from that.
I've studied a small bit of python but I've forgotten basically all of it so I'm back to square one as of right now.
As of writing this I just started the python tutorial on w3schools. I've learned about basic printing statements and whatever "importing modules" means. 
I'm sure i'll figure that out eventually, but for now it all seems like a bunch of jargon. 
I'll write here again once I'm done studying python for this session.

8/18/2025 11:39 PM: Okay I got a bit bored quickly. Variables, data types, printing, modules, whatever all that means. 
Well I know what variables and printing and data types are. Data types seems pretty intuitive and I already know what the other 2 are.
This reminds me of all the programming practice I did when I was like 13 in 2020. 
I was trying to become a roblox developer so I'm a bit familiar with some stuff about programming already. Then I did the html/css/js stuff.
Yeah...
Programming will be an interesting pasttime for me in college for sure (that is if I even have free time. I think I will this upcoming
1st semester anyway). 
And I mainly plan on using it for mathematical computation/physics application stuff. Hopefully that's what I end up using it for
Anyway yeah I think that's all for today for this.
