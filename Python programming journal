Oh my god it is not automatically creating new lines, that's gonna be a bit of an adjustment. Anyway:
I've studied a bit of programming before, so I'm not a totally new to it, but I'd say i'm still a big noob. 
My STEM journey has been exclusively math and physics and other related stuff. I guess computers and programming is a nice addition/deviation from that.
I've studied a small bit of python but I've forgotten basically all of it so I'm back to square one as of right now.
As of writing this I just started the python tutorial on w3schools. I've learned about basic printing statements and whatever "importing modules" means. 
I'm sure i'll figure that out eventually, but for now it all seems like a bunch of jargon. 
I'll write here again once I'm done studying python for this session.
